/* --------------------------------------------------------------
 * Note that this is the third incarnation of m_ident. The first
 * two attempts were pretty crashy, mainly due to the fact we tried
 * to use InspSocket/BufferedSocket to make them work. This class
 * is ok for more heavyweight tasks, it does a lot of things behind
 * the scenes that are not good for ident sockets and it has a huge
 * memory footprint!
 *
 * To fix all the issues that we had in the old ident modules (many
 * nasty race conditions that would cause segfaults etc) we have
 * rewritten this module to use a simplified socket object based
 * directly off EventHandler. As EventHandler only has low level
 * readability, writeability and error events tied directly to the
 * socket engine, this makes our lives easier as nothing happens to
 * our ident lookup class that is outside of this module, or out-
 * side of the control of the class. There are no timers, internal
 * events, or such, which will cause the socket to be deleted,
 * queued for deletion, etc. In fact, there's not even any queueing!
 *
 * Using this framework we have a much more stable module.
 *
 * A few things to note:
 *
 *   O  The only place that may *delete* an active or inactive
 *      ident socket is OnUserDisconnect in the module class.
 *      Because this is out of scope of the socket class there is
 *      no possibility that the socket may ever try to delete
 *      itself.
 *
 *   O  Closure of the ident socket with the Close() method will
 *      not cause removal of the socket from memory or detatchment
 *      from its 'parent' User class. It will only flag it as an
 *      inactive socket in the socket engine.
 *
 *   O  Timeouts are handled in OnCheckReaady at the same time as
 *      checking if the ident socket has a result. This is done
 *      by checking if the age the of the class (its instantiation
 *      time) plus the timeout value is greater than the current time.
 *
 *  O   The ident socket is able to but should not modify its
 *      'parent' user directly. Instead the ident socket class sets
 *      a completion flag and during the next call to OnCheckReady,
 *      the completion flag will be checked and any result copied to
 *      that user's class. This again ensures a single point of socket
 *      deletion for safer, neater code.
 *
 *  O   The code in the constructor of the ident socket is taken from
 *      BufferedSocket but majorly thinned down. It works for both
 *      IPv4 and IPv6.
 *
 *  O   In the event that the ident socket throws a ModuleException,
 *      nothing is done. This is counted as total and complete
 *      failure to create a connection.
