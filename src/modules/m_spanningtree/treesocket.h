/*
 * The server list in InspIRCd is maintained as two structures
 * which hold the data in different ways. Most of the time, we
 * want to very quickly obtain three pieces of information:
 *
 * (1) The information on a server
 * (2) The information on the server we must send data through
 *     to actually REACH the server we're after
 * (3) Potentially, the child/parent objects of this server
 *
 * The InspIRCd spanning protocol provides easy access to these
 * by storing the data firstly in a recursive structure, where
 * each item references its parent item, and a dynamic list
 * of child items, and another structure which stores the items
 * hashed, linearly. This means that if we want to find a server
 * by name quickly, we can look it up in the hash, avoiding
 * any O(n) lookups. If however, during a split or sync, we want
 * to apply an operation to a server, and any of its child objects
 * we can resort to recursion to walk the tree structure.
 * Any socket can have one of five states at any one time.
 *
 * CONNECTING:	indicates an outbound socket which is
 *							waiting to be writeable.
 * WAIT_AUTH_1:	indicates the socket is outbound and
 *							has successfully connected, but has not
 *							yet sent and received SERVER strings.
 * WAIT_AUTH_2:	indicates that the socket is inbound
 *							but has not yet sent and received
 *							SERVER strings.
 * CONNECTED:   represents a fully authorized, fully
 *							connected server.
 * DYING:       represents a server that has had an error.
