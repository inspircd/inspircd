	 *
	 * Each FJOIN is sent along with a timestamp, and the side with the lowest
	 * timestamp 'wins'. From this point on we will refer to this side as the
	 * winner. The side with the higher timestamp loses, from this point on we
	 * will call this side the loser or losing side. This should be familiar to
	 * anyone who's dealt with dreamforge or TS6 before.
	 *
	 * When two sides of a split heal and this occurs, the following things
	 * will happen:
	 *
	 * If the timestamps are exactly equal, both sides merge their privilages
	 * and users, as in InspIRCd 1.0 and ircd2.8. The channels have not been
	 * re-created during a split, this is safe to do.
	 *
	 * If the timestamps are NOT equal, the losing side removes all of its
	 * modes from the channel, before introducing new users into the channel
	 * which are listed in the FJOIN command's parameters. The losing side then
	 * LOWERS its timestamp value of the channel to match that of the winning
	 * side, and the modes of the users of the winning side are merged in with
	 * the losing side.
	 *
	 * The winning side on the other hand will ignore all user modes from the
	 * losing side, so only its own modes get applied. Life is simple for those
	 * who succeed at internets. :-)
