		// present and it doesn't match the user's nick TS, the SVSNICK is not acted upon.
		// This makes it possible to detect the case when services wants to change the nick of a user, but the
		// user changes their nick before the SVSNICK arrives, making the SVSNICK nick change (usually to a guest nick)
		// unnecessary. Consider the following for example:
		//
		// 1. test changes nick to Attila which is protected by services
		// 2. Services SVSNICKs the user to Guest12345
		// 3. Attila changes nick to Attila_ which isn't protected by services
		// 4. SVSNICK arrives
		// 5. Attila_ gets his nick changed to Guest12345 unnecessarily
		//
		// In this case when the SVSNICK is processed the target has already changed their nick to something
		// which isn't protected, so changing the nick again to a Guest nick is not desired.
		// However, if the expected nick TS parameter is present in the SVSNICK then the nick change in step 5
		// won't happen because the timestamps won't match.
