# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently the v3 (old stable) and v4 (stable) branches are actively receiving security fixes. Support for v3 will end at the end of 2025.

The v5 branch is still early in development and only receives security fixes when they are synced from the v3 and v4 branches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report security vulnerabilities on GitHub. Instead, get the attention of a developer in our development IRC channel at irc.chatspike.net #inspircd.dev and PM them the details.

We will triage your issue as soon as possible and try to release a fixed version within a week of receiving your report.
