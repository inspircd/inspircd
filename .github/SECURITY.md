## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report security vulnerabilities on GitHub. Instead, get the attention of a developer in our development IRC channel at ircs://irc.teranova.net/inspircd.dev and PM them the details. If this doesn't get a response please email Sadie at [sadie+inspircd@witchery.services](mailto:sadie+inspircd@witchery.services?subject=%5BInspIRCd%20Security%5D%20) with "InspIRCd Security" in the subject line.

We will triage your issue as soon as possible and try to release a fixed version within a week of receiving your report.
