#  If you want to link servers to InspIRCd you must load the          #
#  m_spanningtree.so module! Please see the modules list below for    #
#  information on how to load this module! If you do not load this    #
#  module, server links will NOT work!                                #

#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#- ULINES CONFIGURATION #-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#
# This tag defines a ulined server. A U-Lined server has special      #
# permissions, and should be used with caution. Services servers are  #
# usually u-lined in this manner.                                     #
#                                                                     #
# The 'silent' value, if set to yes, indicates that this server should#
# not generate quit and connect notices, which can cut down on noise  #
# to opers on the network.                                            #
#                                                                     #
