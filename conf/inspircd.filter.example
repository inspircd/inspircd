# Configuration file for m_filter.so and m_filter_pcre.so

# The tags for this module are formatted as follows:
#
# <keyword      pattern="any glob pattern here"
#               reason="reason for filtering"
#               action="action to take"
#		duration="optional length of gline">
#
# Valid actions for 'action' are:
#
# block         This blocks the line, sends out a notice to all opers with
#               +s and informs the user that their message was blocked.
#
# none          This action causes nothing to be done except logging. This
#               is the default action if none is specified.
#
# kill          This disconnects the user, with the 'reason' parameter as
#               the kill reason.
#
# gline         G-LINE the user for 'duration' length of time. Durations may
#               be specified using the notation 1y2d3h4m6s in a similar way to
#               other glines, omitting the duration or setting it to 0 makes
#               any glines set by this filter be permenant.
#
# You can add filters from IRC using the /FILTER command. If you do this, they
# will be set globally to your entire network.

# Example filters for m_filter:
#
# <keyword pattern="*qwerty*" reason="You qwertied!" action="block">
# <keyword pattern="*killmenow*" reason="As you request." action="kill">
# <keyword pattern="*blah*" reason="Dont blah!" action="gline" duration="1d6h">

# An example regexp filter for m_filter_pcre:
#
# <keyword pattern="^blah.*?$" reason="Dont blah!" action="gline" duration="1d6h">
