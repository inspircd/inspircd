#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-   PORT CONFIGURATION   -#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-
#                                                                     #
#   Enter the port and address bindings here.                         #
#                                                                     #
#  bind address - specifies which address ports bind to. Leaving this #
#                 field blank binds the port to all IPs available.    #
#                                                                     #
#  port         - The port number to bind to. You may specify a port  #
#                 range here, e.g. "6667-6669,7000,7001". If you do   #
#                 this, the server will count each port within your   #
#                 range as a seperate binding, making the above       #
#                 example equivalent to five seperate bind tags.      #
#                 A failure on one port in the range does not prevent #
#                 the entire range from being bound, just that one    #
#                 port number.                                        #
#                                                                     #
#  type         - can be 'clients' or 'servers'. The clients type is  #
#                 a standard tcp based socket, the servers type is a  #
#                 also a TCP based connection but of a different      #
#                 format. SSL support is provided by modules, to      #
#                 enable SSL support, please read the module section  #
#                 of this configuration file.                         #
#                                                                     #
#  ssl          - When using m_ssl_gnutls.so or m_ssl_openssl.so      #
#                 modules, you must define this value to use ssl on   #
#                 that port. valid values are 'gnutls' or 'openssl'   #
#                 respectively. If the module is not loaded, this     #
#                 setting is ignored.                                 #
#                                                                     #
#  transport    - If you have m_spanningtree.so loaded, along with    #
#                 either of the SSL modules (m_ssl_gnutls or          #
#                 m_ssl_openssl) or m_ziplinks.so, then you may make  #
#                 use of this value.                                  #
#                 setting it to 'openssl' or 'gnutls' or 'zip'        #
#                 indicates that the port should accept connections   #
#                 using the given transport name. Transports are      #
#                 layers which sit on top of a socket and change the  #
#                 way data is sent and received, e.g. encryption,     #
#                 compression, and other such things. Because this    #
#                 may not be limited in use to just encryption,       #
#                 the 'ssl' value used for client ports does not      #
#                 exist for servers, and this value is used instead.  #

# If InspIRCd is built for IPV6, and you wish to accept IPV4 clients, #

# use the 4in6 notation, ::ffff:1.2.3.4, where 1.2.3.4 is the IPV4    #
# address to bind the port, but as of InspIRCd 1.1.1, this is not     #

# PLEASE NOTE: If you have build InspIRCd as an ipv6 server, and you  #
# specify an empty bind address, the binding will be bound to ALL THE #
# IPV6 IP ADDRESSES, and not the ipv4 addresses. If you are using an  #
# ipv6 enabled InspIRCd and want to bind to multiple IPV4 addresses   #
# in this way, you must specify them by hand. If you have built the   #
# server for ipv4 connections only, then specifying an empty bind     #
# address binds the port to all ipv4 IP addresses, as expected.       #

#   IP masks may be specified in CIDR format or wildcard format,      #
#   for IPV4 and IPV6. You *cannot* use hostnames in the allow or     #
#   deny field, as the state is applied before the user's DNS has     #
#   been resolved.                                                    #
#                                                                     #
#   You may optionally include timeout="x" on any allow line, which   #
#   specifies the amount of time given before an unknown connection   #
#   is closed if USER/NICK/PASS are not given. This value is in secs  #
#                                                                     #
#   You should also include a flood="x" line which indicates          #
#   the number of lines a user may place into their buffer at once    #
#   before they are disconnected for excess flood. This feature can   #
#   not be disabled, however it can be set to extremely high values,  #
#   rendering it effectively disabled. A recommended value is 10.     #
#   A counter is maintained for each user which is reset every        #
#   'threshold' seconds and specifying this threshold value with      #
#   threshold="X" indicates how often the counter is reset. For       #
#   example, with flood="5" and threshold="8", the user may not send  #
#   more than 5 lines in 8 secs.                                      #
#                                                                     #
#   You may optionally specify the sendq size and ping frequency of   #
#   each connect:allow line using the pingfreq="X" and sendq="X"      #
#   settings as shown in the full example below.                      #
#   The ping frequency is specified in seconds, and the sendq size    #
#   in bytes. It is recommended, although not enforced, that you      #
#   should never set your sendq size to less than 8k. Send Queues are #
#   dynamically allocated and can grow as needed up to the maximum    #
#   size specified.                                                   #
#                                                                     #
#   The optional recvq value is the maximum size which users in this  #
#   group may grow their receive queue to. This is recommended to be  #
#   kept pretty low compared to the sendq, as users will always       #
#   receive more than they send in normal circumstances. The default  #
#   if not specified is 4096.                                         #
#                                                                     #
#   The sendq is the data waiting to be sent TO THE USER.             #
#   The recvq is the data being received FROM THE USER.               #
#   The names sendq and recvq are from the SERVER'S PERSPECTIVE not   #
#   that of the user... Just to clear up any confusion or complaints  #
#   that these are backwards :p                                       #
#                                                                     #
#   The localmax and globalmax values can be used to enforce local    #
#   and global session limits on connections. The session limits are  #
#   counted against all users, but applied only to users within the   #
#   class. For example, if you had a class 'A' which has a session    #
#   limit of 3, and a class 'B' which has a session limit of 5, and   #
#   somehow, two users managed to get into class B which also match   #
#   class A, there is only one connection left for this IP now in A,  #
#   but if they can connect again to B, there are three. You get the  #
#   idea (i hope).                                                    #
#                                                                     #
#   The optional port value determines which port the connect tag is  #
#   handling. If left out the connect tag covers all bound ports else #
#   only incoming connections on the specified port will match. Port  #
#   tags may be used on connect allow and connect deny tags.          #
#                                                                     #

#   Opers are defined here. This is a very important section.         #
#   Remember to only make operators out of trust worthy people.       #

#  password    - password to oper-up, also case sensitive.            #
#                encryption is supported via modules. You may load    #
#                modules for MD5 or SHA256 encryption, and if you do, #
#                this value will be a hash value, otherwise put a     #
#                plaintext password in this value.                    #
#                                                                     #
#  host        - hosts of client allowed to oper-up.                  #
#                wildcards accepted, seperate multiple hosts with a   #
#                space. You may also specify CIDR IP addresses.       #
#                                                                     #
#  fingerprint - when using the m_ssl_oper_cert.so module, you may    #
#                specify a key fingerprint here. This can be obtained #
#                using the /fingerprint command whilst the module is  #
#                loaded, or from the notice given to you when you     #
#                connect to the ircd using a client certificate,      #
#                and will lock this oper block to only the user who   #
#                has that specific key/certificate pair.              #
#                this enhances security a great deal, however it      #
#                requires that opers use clients which can send ssl   #
#                client certificates, if this is configured for that  #
#                oper. Note that if the m_ssl_oper.so module is not   #
#                loaded, and/or one of m_ssl_openssl or m_ssl_gnutls  #
#                is not loaded, this configuration option has no      #

#                                                                     #
# transport     - if defined, this is a transport name implemented by #
#                 another module. Transports are layers on top of     #
#                 plaintext connections, which alter them in certain  #
#                 ways. Currently the three supported transports are  #
#                 'openssl' and 'gnutls' which are types of SSL       #
#                 encryption, and 'zip' which is for compression.     #
#                 If you define a transport, both ends of the         #
#                 connection must use a compatible transport for the  #
#                 link to succeed. OpenSSL and GnuTLS are link-       #
#                 compatible with each other.                         #
#                                                                     #
# statshidden   - when using m_spanningtree.so for linking. you may   #
#                 set this to 'yes', and if you do, the IP address/   #
#                 hostname of this connection will NEVER be shown to  #
#                 any opers on the network. In /stats c its address   #
#                 will show as *@<hidden>, and during CONNECT and     #
#                 inbound connections, it's IP will show as <hidden>  #
#                 UNLESS the connection fails (e.g. due to a bad      #
#                 password or servername)                             #
#                                                                     #
# allowmask     - when this is defined, it indicates a range of IP    #
#                 addresses to allow for this link (You may use CIDR  #
#                 or wildcard form for this address).                 #
#                 e.g. if your server is going to connect to you from #
#                 the range 1.2.3.1 through 1.2.3.255, put 1.2.3.0/24 #
#                 into this value. If it is not defined, then only    #
#                 the ipaddr field of the server shall be allowed.    #
#                                                                     #
# failover      - if you define this option, it must be the name of a #
#                 different link tag in your configuration. This      #
#                 option causes the ircd to attempt a connection to   #
#                 the failover link in the event that the connection  #
#                 to this server fails. For example, you could define #
#                 two hub uplinks to a leaf server, and set an        #
#                 american server to autoconnect, with a european     #
#                 hub as its failover. In this situation, your ircd   #
#                 will only try the link to the european hub if the   #
#                 american hub is unreachable. NOTE that for the      #
#                 intents and purposes of this option, an unreachable #
#                 server is one which DOES NOT ANSWER THE CONNECTION. #
#                 If the server answers the connection with accept(), #
#                 EVEN IF THE CREDENTIALS ARE INVALID, the failover   #
#                 link will not be tried! Failover settings will also #
#                 apply to autoconnected servers as well as manually  #
#                 connected ones.                                     #
#                                                                     #
# timeout       - if this is defined, then outbound connections will  #
#                 time out if they are not connected within this many #
#                 seconds. If this is not defined, the default of ten #
#                 seconds is used.                                    #
#                                                                     #
# bind          - if you specify this value, then when creating an    #
#                 outbound connection to the given server, the IP you #
#                 place here will be bound to. This is for multi-     #
#                 homed servers which may have multiple IP addresses. #
#                 if you do not define this value, the first IP that  #
#                 is not empty or localhost from your <bind> tags     #
#                 will be bound to. This is usually acceptable,       #
#                 however if your server has multiple network cards   #
#                 then you may have to manually specify the bind      #
#                 value instead of leaving it to automatic binding.   #
#                 you can usually tell if you need to set this by     #
#                 looking for the error 'Could not assign requested   #
#                 address' in your log when connecting to servers.    #
#                                                                     #
# hidden        - if this is set to true, yes, or 1, then the server  #
#                 is completely hidden from non-opers. It does not    #
#                 show in /links and it does not show in /map. Also,  #
#                 any servers which are child servers of this one     #
#                 in the network will *also* be hidden. Use with      #
#                 care! You can use this to 'mask off' sections of    #
#                 the network so that users only see a small portion  #
#                 of a much larger net. It should NOT be relied upon  #
#                 as a security tool, unless it is being used for     #
#                 example to hide a non-client hub, for which clients #
#                 do not have an IP address or resolvable hostname.   #
#                                                                     #
# to u:line a server (give it extra privilages required for running   #
# services, Q, etc) you must include the <uline server> tag as shown  #
# in the example below. You can have as many of these as you like.    #
#                                                                     #
# WARNING: Unlike other ircds, u:lining a server allows ALL users on  #
# that server to operoverride modes. This should only be used for     #
# services and protected oper servers!                                #
#                                                                     #

# NOTE: If you have built your server as an IPv6 server, then when a  #
# DNS lookup of a server's host occurs, AAAA records (IPv6) are       #
# priorotized over A records (IPv4). Therefore, if the server you are #
# connecting to has both an IPv6 IP address and an IPv4 IP address in #
# its DNS entry, the IPv6 address will *always* be selected. To       #
# change this behaviour simply specify the IPv4 IP address rather     #
# than the hostname of the server.                                    #
#                                                                     #

#  If you want to link servers to InspIRCd you must load the          #
#  m_spanningtree.so module! Please see the modules list below for    #
#  information on how to load this module! If you do not load this    #
#  module, server links will NOT work!                                #

#  Also, if you define any transports, you must load the modules for  #
#  these transports BEFORE you load m_spanningtree, e.g. place them   #
#  above it in the configuration file. Currently this means the three #
#  modules m_ssl_gnutls, m_ziplinks and m_ssl_openssl, depending on   #

# Define your DNS server address here. InspIRCd has its own resolver. #

# recursive lookups itself, to save time and resources. The dns       #
# server recommended by the InspIRCd team is bind, available from the #
# ISC website. If your DNS server does not do a recursive lookup, you #
# will be able to notice this by the fact that none of your users are #
# resolving even though the DNS server appears to be up! Most ISP and #
# hosting provider DNS servers support recursive lookups.             #

#   Settings to define which features are useable on your server.     #
#                                                                     #
#  prefixquit    - A prefix to be placed on the start of a client's   #
#                  quit message                                       #
#                                                                     #
#  suffixquit    - A suffix to be placed on the end of a client's     #
#                  quit message.                                      #
#                                                                     #
#  fixedquit     - A fixed quit message to display for all client     #
#                  QUITS. If specified, overrides both prefixquit     #
#                  and suffixquit options.                            #
#                                                                     #
#  loglevel      - specifies what detail of messages to log in the    #
#                  log file. You may select from debug, verbose,      #
#                  default, sparse and none.                          #
#                                                                     #
#  allowhalfop   - allows the +h channel mode                         #
#                                                                     #
#  noservices    - If noservices is true, yes, or 1, then the first   #
#                  user into a channel gets founder status. This is   #
#                  only useful on networks running the m_chanprotect  #
#                  module without services.                           #
#                                                                     #
#  qaprefixes    - If qaprefixes is true, yes, or 1, then users       #
#                  with +q or +a will get the ~ or & prefixes         #
#                  used in unreal. This is only useful on networks    #
#                  running the m_chanprotect module                   #
#                                                                     #
#  deprotectself - If this value is set to yes, true, or 1, then any  #
#                  user with +q or +a may remove the +q or +a from    #
#                  themselves. The default setting is to not enable   #
#                  this feature, which stops even the founder taking  #
#                  away their founder status without using services.  #
#                                                                     #
#  deprotectothers-If this value is set to yes, true, or 1, then any  #
#                  user with +q or +a may remove the +q or +a from    #
#                  other users. The default setting is to not enable  #
#                  this feature, so that only +q may remove +a, and   #
#                  nothing but services may remove +q.                #
#                                                                     #
#  cyclehosts    - If this is set to true, yes or 1, then when a      #
#                  user's hostname changes, they will appear to quit  #
#                  and then rejoin with their new host. This prevents #
#                  clients from being confused by host changes,       #
#                  especially in the case of bots, and it is          #
#                  recommended that this option is enabled.           #
#                                                                     #
#  netbuffersize - size of the buffer used to receive data from       #
#                  clients. The ircd may only read() this amount      #
#                  of text in one go at any time. (OPTIONAL)          #
#                                                                     #
#  maxwho        - The maximum number of results returned by a /WHO   #
#                  query. This is to prevent /WHO being used as a     #
#                  spam vector or means of flooding an ircd. The      #
#                  default is 128, it is not recommended to raise it  #
#                  above 1024. Values up to 65535 are permitted. If   #
#                  this value is omitted, any size WHO is allowed by  #
#                  anyone.                                            #
#                                                                     #
#  somaxconn     - The maximum number of sockets that may be waiting  #
#                  in the accept queue. This usually allows the ircd  #
#                  to soak up more connections in a shorter space of  #
#                  time when increased but please be aware there is a #
#                  system defined maximum value to this, the same way #
#                  there is a system defined maximum number of file   #
#                  descriptors. Some systems may only allow this to   #
#                  be up to 5 (ugh) while others such as FreeBSD will #
#                  default to a much nicer 128.                       #
#                                                                     #
#  moduledir     - This optional value indicates a runtime change of  #
#                  the location where modules are to be found. This   #
#                  does not add a supplementary directory. There can  #
#                  only be one module path.                           #
#                                                                     #
#  softlimit     - This optional feature allows a defined softlimit.  #
#                  if defined sets a soft maxconnections value, has   #
#                  to be less than the ./configure maxclients         #
#                                                                     #
#  userstats     - The userstats field is optional and specifies      #
#                  which stats characters in /STATS may be requested  #
#                  by non-operators. Stats characters in this field   #
#                  are case sensitive and are allowed to users        #
#                  independent of if they are in a module or the core #
#                                                                     #
#  operspywhois  - If this is set then when an IRC operator uses      #
#                  /WHOIS on a user they will see all channels, even  #
#                  ones if channels are secret (+s), private (+p) or  #
#                  if the target user is invisible +i.                #
#                                                                     #
#  customversion - If you specify this configuration item, and it is  #
#                  not set to an empty value, then when a user does   #
#                  a /VERSION command on the ircd, this string will   #
#                  be displayed as the second portion of the output,  #
#                  replacing the system 'uname', compile flags and    #
#                  socket engine/dns engine names. You may use this   #
#                  to enhance security, or simply for vanity.         #
#                                                                     #
#  maxtargets    - The maxtargets field is optional, and if not       #
#                  defined, defaults to 20. It indicates the maximum  #
#                  number of targets which may be given to commands   #
#                  such as PRIVMSG, KICK etc.                         #
#                                                                     #
#  hidesplits    - When set to 'yes', will hide split server names    #
#                  from non-opers. Non-opers will see '*.net *.split' #
#                  instead of the server names in the quit message,   #
#                  identical to the way IRCu displays them.           #
#                                                                     #
#  hidebans      - When set to 'yes', will hide gline, kline, zline   #
#                  and qline quit messages from non-opers. For        #
#                  example, user A who is not an oper will just see   #
#                  (G-Lined) while user B who is an oper will see the #
#                  text (G-Lined: Reason here) instead.               #
#                                                                     #
#  hidewhois     - When defined with a non-empty value, the given     #
#                  text will be used in place of the user's server    #
#                  in WHOIS, when a user is WHOISed by a non-oper.    #
#                  For example, most nets will want to set this to    #
#                  something like '*.netname.net' to conceal the      #
#                  actual server the user is on.                      #
#                                                                     #
#  flatlinks     - When you are using m_spanningtree.so, and this     #
#                  value is set to true, yes or 1, /MAP and /LINKS    #
#                  will be flattened when shown to a non-oper.        #
#                                                                     #
#  hideulines    - When you are using m_spanningtree.so, and this     #
#                  value is set to true, yes or 1, then U-lined       #
#                  servers will be hidden in /LINKS and /MAP. For non #
#                  opers. Please be aware that this will also hide    #
#                  any leaf servers of a U-lined server, e.g. jupes.  #
#                                                                     #
#  nouserdns     - If set to 'yes', 'true' or '1', no user dns        #
#                  lookups will be performed for connecting users.    #
#                  this can save a lot of resources on very busy irc  #
#                  servers.                                           #
#                                                                     #
#  syntaxhints   - If set to 'yes', 'true' or '1', when a user does   #
#                  not give enough parameters for a command, a syntax #
#                  hint will be given (using the RPL_TEXT numeric)    #
#                  as well as the standard ERR_NEEDMOREPARAMS.        #
#                                                                     #
#  announcets    - If this value is defined to 'yes', 'true' or '1',  #
#                  then if a channel's timestamp is updated the users #
#                  on the channel will be informed of the change via  #
#                  a server notice to the channel with the old and    #
#                  new TS values in the timestamp. If you think this  #
#                  is just pointless noise, define the value to 0.    #
#                                                                     #
#  ircumsgprefix - Use undernet style message prefix for channel      #
#                  NOTICE and PRIVMSG adding the prefix to the line   #
#                  of text sent out. Eg. NOTICE @#test :@ testing     #
#                  vs. the off setting: NOTICE @#test :testing        #
#                                                                     #
#  hostintopic   - If this is set to yes (the default) then the full  #
#                  nick!user@host is shown for who set a TOPIC last.  #
#                  if set to no, then only the nickname is shown.     #
#                                                                     #
# announceinvites                                                     #
#                - If this option is set to yes (the default), then   #
#                  invites are announced to the channel when a user   #
#                  invites annother user. If you consider this to be  #
#                  unnecessary noise, explicitly set this to no.      #
#                                                                     #
#  disablehmac   - If you are linking your InspIRCd to older versions #
#                  then you can specify this option and set it to     #
#                  yes. 1.1.6 and above support HMAC and challenge-   #
#                  response for password authentication. These can    #
#                  greatly enhance security of your server to server  #
#                  connections when you are not using SSL (as is the  #
#                  case with a lot of larger networks). Linking to    #
#                  older versions of InspIRCd should not *usually* be #
#                  a problem, but if you have problems with HMAC      #
#                  authentication, this option can be used to turn it #
#                  off.                                               #
#                                                                     #
#  hidemodes     - If this option is enabled, then the listmodes      #
#                  given (e.g. +eI), will be hidden from users below  #
#                  halfop. This is not recommended to be set on mode  #
#                  +b, as it may break some features in popular       #
#                  clients such as mIRC.                              #
#                                                                     #
#  quietbursts   - When synching or splitting from the network, a     #
#                  server can generate a lot of connect and quit      #
#                  snotices to the +C and +Q snomasks. Setting this   #
#                  value to yes squelches those messages, which can   #
#                  make them more useful for opers, however it will   #
#                  degrade their use by certain third party programs  #
#                  such as BOPM which rely on them to scan users when #
#                  a split heals in certain configurations.           #
#                                                                     #

# Because IRC is very time and clock dependent, InspIRCd provides its #
# own methods for syncronization of time between servers as shown     #
# in the example below, for servers that don't have ntpd running.     #
#                                                                     #
#  enable    -     If this value is 'yes', 'true', or '1', time       #
#                  synchronization is enabled on this server. This    #
#                  means any servers you are linked to will           #
#                  automatically synchronize time, however you should #
#                  use ntpd instead where possible, NOT this option.  #
#                                                                     #
#  master    -     If this value is set to yes, then this server will #
#                  act as the authoritative time source for the whole #
#                  network. All other servers will respect its time   #
#                  without question, and match their times to it.     #
#                  only one server should have the master value set   #

#  These tags define which modules will be loaded on startup by your  #
#  server. Add modules without any paths. When you make your ircd     #
#  using the 'make' command, all compiled modules will be moved into  #
#  the folder you specified when you ran ./configure. The module tag  #
#  automatically looks for modules in this location.                  #
#  If you attempt to load a module outside of this location, either   #
#  in the config, or via /LOADMODULE, you will receive an error.      #

#  By default, ALL modules are commented out. You must uncomment them #

# If you have the m_alias.so module loaded, you may also define       #
# aliases as shown below. They are commonly used to provide shortcut  #

# An alias tag requires the following values to be defined in it:     #
#                                                                     #

#                    Cant contain spaces, but case insensitive.       #
#                    You may have multiple aliases with the same      #
#                    command name (text="" value), however the first  #
#                    found will be executed if its format value is    #
#                    matched, or it has no format value. Aliases are  #
#                    read from the top of the file to the bottom.     #
#                                                                     #
# format      -      If this is defined, the parameters of the alias  #
#                    must match this glob pattern. For example if you #
#                    want the first parameter to start with a # for   #
#                    the alias to be executed, set format="#*" in the #
#                    alias definition. Note that the :'s which are    #
#                    part of IRC formatted lines will be preserved    #
#                    for matching of this text. This value is         #
#                    optional.                                        #

# replace     -      The text to replace 'text' with. Usually this    #
#                    will be "PRIVMSG ServiceName :$2-" or similar.   #
#                    You may use the variables $1 through $9 in the   #
#                    replace string, which refer to the first through #
#                    ninth word in the original string typed by the   #
#                    user. You may also use $1- through $9- which     #
#                    refer to the first word onwards, through to the  #
#                    ninth word onwards, e.g. if the user types the   #
#                    command "foo bar baz qux quz" then $3- will hold #
#                    "baz qux quz" and $2 will contain "bar". You may #
#                    also use the special variables: $nick, $ident,   #
#                    $host and $vhost, and you may seperate multiple  #
#                    commands with \n. If you wish to use the ACTUAL  #

# requires    -      If you provide a value for 'requires' this means #
#                    the given nickname MUST be online for the alias  #
#                    to successfully trigger. If they are not, then   #
#                    the user receives a 'no such nick' 401 numeric.  #

# uline       -      Defining this value with 'yes', 'true' or '1'    #
#                    will ensure that the user given in 'requires'    #
#                    must also be on a u-lined server, as well as     #
#                    actually being on the network. If the user is    #

# operonly    -      Defining this value, with a value of 'yes', '1'  #

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# ---------------
#
# When you connect CGI:IRC clients, there are two connect classes which
# apply to these clients. When the client initially connects, the connect
# class which matches the cgi:irc site's host is checked. Therefore you
# must raise the maximum local/global clients for this ip as high as you
# want to allow cgi clients. After the client has connected and is
# determined to be a cgi:irc client, the class which matches the client's
# real IP is then checked. You may set this class to a lower value, so that
# the real IP of the client can still be restricted to, for example, 3
# sessions maximum.

# This optional tag allows you to specify how wide a gline, eline,    #
# kline, zline or qline can be before it is forbidden from being      #
# set. By setting hostmasks="yes", you can allow all G, K, E lines,   #
# no matter how many users the ban would cover. This is not           #
# recommended! By setting ipmasks="yes", you can allow all Z lines,   #
# no matter how many users these cover too. Needless to say we        #
# don't recommend you do this, or, set nickmasks="yes", which will    #
# allow any qline.                                                    #

# The trigger value indicates how wide any mask will be before it is  #
# prevented from being set. The default value is 95.5% if this tag is #
# not defined in your configuration file, meaning that if your        #
# network has 1000 users, a gline matching over 955 of them will be   #
# prevented from being added.                                         #
