# Logging
# -------
#
# Logging is covered with the <log> tag, which you may use to change
# the behaviour of the logging of the IRCd.
#
# In InspIRCd as of 1.2, logging is pluggable and very extensible.
# Different files can log the same thing, different 'types' of log can
# go to different places, and modules can even extend the log tag
# to do what they want.
#
# An example log tag would be:
#	<log method="file" type="OPER" level="default" target="opers.log">
# which  would log all information on /oper (failed and successful) to
# a file called opers.log.
#
# There are many different types which may be used, and modules may
# generate their own. A list of useful types:
#	- USERS - information relating to user connection and disconnection
#	- CHANNELS - information relating to joining and parting of channels.
# XXX someone doc more on this
#
# You may also log *everything* by using a type of *, and subtract things out
# of that by using -TYPE - for example "* -m_spanningtree -m_cgiirc".
#
# The following log tag is highly default and uncustomised. It is recommended you
# sort out your own log tags. This is just here so you get some output.
<log method="file" type="*" level="default" target="ircd.log">

# Here are some pre-built modules.conf files that closely match the
# default configurations of some popular IRCd's. You still may want to
# look over them and make sure if everything is correct for you and setup
# the proper SSL information.
#
# *NOTE*: These files have no comments for what the modules do. If you
# are interested in that, please read the modules.conf.example. It is also
# recommended that you make your own modules file based on modules.conf.example.
