# This configuration tag defines the maximum sizes of various types   #
# on IRC, such as the maximum length of a channel name, and the       #
# maximum length of a channel. Note that with the exception of the    #
# identmax value all values given here are the exact values you would #
# expect to see on IRC. This contrasts with the older InspIRCd        #
# releases where these values would be one character shorter than     #
# defined to account for a null terminator on the end of the text.    #
#                                                                     #

# This configuration tag defines the location that InspIRCd stores    #
# various types of files such as configuration files, log files and   #
# modules. You will probably not need to change these from the values #

# Logging
# -------
#
# Logging is covered with the <log> tag, which you may use to change
# the behaviour of the logging of the IRCd.
#
# In InspIRCd as of 1.2, logging is pluggable and very extensible.
# Different files can log the same thing, different 'types' of log can
# go to different places, and modules can even extend the log tag
# to do what they want.
#
# An example log tag would be:
#  <log method="file" type="OPER" level="default" target="opers.log">
# which would log all information on /oper (failed and successful) to
# a file called opers.log.
#
# There are many different types which may be used, and modules may
# generate their own. A list of useful types:
#  - USERS - information relating to user connection and disconnection
#  - OPER - succesful and failed oper attempts
#  - KILL - kill related messages
#  - snomask - server notices (*all* snomasks will be logged)
#  - FILTER - messages related to filter matches (filter module)
#  - CONFIG - configuration related messages
#  - COMMAND - die and restart messages, and messages related to unknown user types
#  - SOCKET - socket engine informational/error messages
#  - MODULE - module related messages
#  - STARTUP - messages related to starting up the server
#
# You may also log *everything* by using a type of *, and subtract things out
# of that by using -TYPE - for example "* -USERINPUT -USEROUTPUT".
#
# Useful levels are:
#  - default (general messages, including errors)
#  - sparse (misc error messages)
#  - debug (debug messages)
#
# Some types only produce output in the debug level, those are:
#  - BANCACHE - ban cache debug messages
#  - CHANNELS - information relating to joining/creating channels
#  - CULLLIST - debug messages related to issues with removing users
#  - RESOLVER - DNS related debug messages
#  - CONNECTCLASS - Connection class debug messages
#  - USERINPUT
#  - USEROUTPUT
#
# If your server is producing a high levels of log messages you can also set the
# flush="[positive number]" attribute to specify how many log messages should be
# buffered before flushing to disk. You should probably not specify this unless
# you are having problems.
#
# The following log tag is highly default and uncustomised. It is recommended you
# sort out your own log tags. This is just here so you get some output.
