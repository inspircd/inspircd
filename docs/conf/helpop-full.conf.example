                    customprefix module).

                    (requires inviteexception module).

 c                  Blocks messages containing mIRC color codes

                    see themselves or themselves and the operators,
                    while operators see all the users (requires
                    auditorium module).

 K                  Blocks /KNOCK on the channel.
 L [channel]        If the channel reaches its limit set by +l,

                    services account module).

                    channel (requirs stripcolor module).

                    not at least halfop (requires nonotice module).
 
 g [mask]           Blocks messages matching the given blob mask
                    (requires chanfilter module).
 X [mode]           Makes channel operators immune to the specified
                    restrictive mode (requires exemptchanops module).

NOTE: A large number of these modes are dependent upon server-side modules
being loaded by a server/network administrator. The actual modes available
on your network may be very different to this list. Please consult your

#      EXTBANS       #
######################

<helpop key="extbans" value="Extended Bans
----------

Extbans are split into two types; matching extbans, which match on
users in additional ways, and acting extbans, which restrict users
in different ways to a standard ban.

To use an extban, simply set +b <ban> or +e <ban> with it as the ban,
instead of a normal nick!user@host mask, to ban or exempt matching
users. Ban exceptions on acting extbans exempt that user from matching
an extban of that type, and from any channel mode corresponding to the
restriction. Matching extbans may also be used for invite exceptions by
setting +I <extban>.

Matching extbans:

 j:#channel    Matches anyone in #channel. Does not support wildcards
               for #channel (requires channelban module).
 r:realname    Matches users with a matching realname (requires gecosban
               module).
 s:server      Matches users on a matching server (requires serverban
               module).
 z:fingerprint Matches users with a matching ssl fingerprint (requires
               sslmodes module)
 O:opertype    Matches IRCops of a matching type, mostly useful as an
               an invite exception (requires operchans module).
 R:account     Matches users logged into a matching account (requires
               services account module).

Acting extbans:

 c:<ban>       Blocks any messages that contain color codes from
               matching users (requires blockcolor module).
 m:<ban>       Blocks messages from matching users (requires muteban
               module). Users with +v or above are not affected.
 p:<ban>       Blocks part messages from matching users (requires
               nopartmsg module).
 A:<ban>       Blocks invites by matching users even when +A is set
               (requires allowinvite module).
 C:<ban>       Blocks CTCPs from matching users (requires noctcp
               module).
 N:<ban>       Blocks nick changes from matching users (requires
               nonicks module).
 Q:<ban>       Blocks kicks by matching users (requires nokicks
               module).
 S:<ban>       Strips color/bold/underline from messages from matching
               users (requires stripcolor module).
 T:<ban>       Blocks notices from matching users (requires nonotice
               module).
 U:<ban>       Blocks unregistered users matching the given ban.
               (requires m_services_account)

A ban given to an acting extban may either be a nick!user@host mask,
matched against users as for a normal ban, or a matching extban.

There is an additional special type of extended ban, a redirect ban:

 Redirect      n!u@h#channel will redirect the banned user to #channel
               when they try to join (requires banredirect module).">
