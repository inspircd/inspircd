        (realname) fields.
 m      Search for all users with a given set of user modes. When
        this flag is set it overrides the meaning of the
        search-pattern, which must contain the mode sequence to

        without +s, issue the command WHO +i-s m (IRC operators only)

<helpop key="extbans" value="Extended Bans
----------

Extbans are split into two types; matching extbans, which match on
users in additional ways, and acting extbans, which restrict users
in different ways to a standard ban.

To use an extban, simply set +b <ban> or +e <ban> with it as the ban,
instead of a normal nick!user@host mask, to ban or exempt matching
users. Ban exceptions on acting extbans exempt that user from matching
an extban of that type, and from any channel mode corresponding to the
restriction. Matching extbans may also be used for invite exceptions by
setting +I <extban>.

Matching extbans:

 j:<channel>   Matches anyone in the given channel. Does not support
               wildcards (requires the channelban module).
 r:<realname>  Matches users with a matching realname (requires the
               gecosban module).
 s:<server>    Matches users on a matching server (requires the
               serverban module).
 z:<certfp>    Matches users having the given SSL certificate
               fingerprint (requires the sslmodes module).
 O:<opertype>  Matches IRCops of a matching type, mostly useful as an
               an invite exception (requires the operchans module).
 R:<account>   Matches users logged into a matching account (requires
               the services account module).
 U:<banmask>   Matches unregistered users matching the given banmask.
               (requires the services account module).

Acting extbans:

 c:<banmask>   Blocks any messages that contain formatting codes from
               matching users (requires the blockcolor module).
 m:<banmask>   Blocks messages from matching users (requires the muteban
               module). Users with +v or above are not affected.
 p:<banmask>   Blocks part messages from matching users (requires
               the nopartmsg module).
 A:<banmask>   Blocks invites by matching users even when +A is set
               (requires the allowinvite module).
 B:<banmask>   Blocks all capital or nearly all capital messages from
               matching users (requires the blockcaps module).
 C:<banmask>   Blocks CTCPs from matching users (requires the noctcp
               module).
 N:<banmask>   Blocks nick changes from matching users (requires
               the nonicks module).
 Q:<banmask>   Blocks kicks by matching users (requires the nokicks
               module).
 S:<banmask>   Strips formatting codes from messages from matching
               users (requires the stripcolor module).
 T:<banmask>   Blocks notices from matching users (requires the
               nonotice module).

A ban given to an Acting extban may either be a nick!user@host mask
(unless stated otherwise), matched against users as for a normal ban,
or a Matching extban.

There is an additional special type of extended ban, a redirect ban:

 Redirect      n!u@h#channel will redirect the banned user to #channel
               when they try to join (requires the banredirect module).">
