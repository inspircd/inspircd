#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-  CLASS CONFIGURATION   -#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-
#                                                                     #
#   Classes are a group of commands which are grouped together and    #
#   given a unique name. They're used to define which commands        #
#   are available to certain types of Operators.                      #
#                                                                     #

#  Note: It is possible to make a class which covers all available    #
#  commands. To do this, specify commands="*". This is not really     #
#  recommended, as it negates the whole purpose of the class system,  #
#  however it is provided for fast configuration (e.g. in test nets). #
#                                                                     #

      # a key fingerprint here. This can be obtained by using the /sslinfo
      # command while the module is loaded, and is also noticed on connect.
      # This enhances security by verifying that the person opering up has
      # a matching SSL client certificate, which is very difficult to
