#   Classes are a group of commands which are grouped together and    #
#   given a unique name. They're used to define which commands        #
#   are available to certain types of Operators.                      #
#                                                                     #

#  Note: It is possible to make a class which covers all available    #
#  commands. To do this, specify commands="*". This is not really     #
#  recommended, as it negates the whole purpose of the class system,  #
#  however it is provided for fast configuration (e.g. in test nets). #
#                                                                     #

     #  VIEWING:
     #   - channels/auspex: allows opers with this priv to see more details about channels than normal users.
     #   - users/auspex: allows opers with this priv to view more details about users than normal users, e.g. real host and IP.
     #   - users/channel-spy: allows opers with this priv to view the private/secret channels that a user is on.
     #   - servers/auspex: allows opers with this priv to see more details about server information than normal users.
     #  ACTIONS:
     #   - users/mass-message: allows opers with this priv to PRIVMSG and NOTICE to a server mask (e.g. NOTICE $*).
     #   - users/samode-usermodes: allows opers with this priv to change the user modes of any other user using /SAMODE.
     #  PERMISSIONS:
     #   - channels/ignore-noctcp: allows opers with this priv to send a CTCP to a +C channel.
     #   - channels/ignore-nonicks: allows opers with this priv to change their nick when on a +N channel.
     #   - channels/restricted-create: allows opers with this priv to create channels if the restrictchans module is loaded.
     #   - users/flood/increased-buffers: allows opers with this priv to send and receive data without worrying about being disconnected for exceeding limits (*NOTE).
     #   - users/flood/no-fakelag: prevents opers from being penalized with fake lag for flooding (*NOTE).
     #   - users/flood/no-throttle: allows opers with this priv to send commands without being throttled (*NOTE).
     #   - users/ignore-callerid: allows opers with this priv to message people using callerid without being on their callerid list.
     #   - users/ignore-commonchans: allows opers with this priv to send a message to a +c user without sharing common channels.
     #   - users/ignore-noctcp: allows opers with this priv to send a CTCP to a +T user.
     #   - users/ignore-privdeaf: allows opers with this priv to message users with +D set.
     #   - users/sajoin-others: allows opers with this priv to /SAJOIN users other than themselves.
     #   - servers/use-disabled-commands: allows opers with this priv to use disabled commands.
     #   - servers/use-disabled-modes: allows opers with this priv to use disabled modes.
