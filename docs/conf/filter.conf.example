# Configuration file for the filter module

# The tags for this module are formatted as follows:
#
# <keyword      pattern="any glob pattern here"
#               reason="reason for filtering"
#               action="action to take"
#               flags="filter flags"
#		duration="optional length of gline">
#
# Valid actions for 'action' are:
#
# block         This blocks the line, sends out a notice to all opers with
#               +s and informs the user that their message was blocked.
#
# silent        This blocks the line only, and informs the user their message
#               was blocked, but does not notify opers.
#
# none          This action causes nothing to be done except logging. This
#               is the default action if none is specified.
#
# kill          This disconnects the user, with the 'reason' parameter as
#               the kill reason.
#
# gline         G-LINE the user for 'duration' length of time. Durations may
#               be specified using the notation 1y2d3h4m6s in a similar way to
#               other glines, omitting the duration or setting it to 0 makes
#               any glines set by this filter be permanent.
#
# You can add filters from IRC using the /FILTER command. If you do this, they
# will be set globally to your entire network.
#
# Valid characters for 'flags' are one or more of:
#
# p: Block private and channel messages
# n: Block private and channel notices
# P: Block part messages
# q: Block quit messages
# o: Don't match against opers
# c: Strip color codes from text before trying to match
# *: Represents all of the above flags
# -: Does nothing, a no-op for when you do not want to specify any flags
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: Because the InspIRCd config reader places special meaning on the
# '\' character, you must use '\\' if you wish to specify a '\' character in a regular
# expression. For example, to indicate numbers, use \\d and not \d. This does not
# apply when adding a regular expression over irc with the /FILTER command.

# Example filters:
#
# <keyword pattern="*qwerty*" reason="You qwertied!" action="block" flags="pn">
# <keyword pattern="*killmenow*" reason="As you request." action="kill" flags="*">
# <keyword pattern="*blah*" reason="Dont blah!" action="gline" duration="1d6h" flags="-">

# An example regexp filter:
#
# <keyword pattern="^blah.*?$" reason="Dont blah!" action="gline" duration="1d6h" flags="pnPq">

# You may specify specific channels that are exempt from being filtered:
#<exemptfromfilter target="#opers">
#<exemptfromfilter target="#help">

# You can also exempt messages from being filtered if they are sent to
# specific nicks.
# Example that exempts all messages sent *to* NickServ:
#<exemptfromfilter target="NickServ">

# Note that messages *from* services are never subject to filtering;
# <exemptfromfilter> tags are only for exempting messages sent *to* the
# configured targets.
