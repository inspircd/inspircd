 2) The specified pattern is an exact nickname.
 3) You share one or more common channels with the user.
 4) The user does not have the invisible user mode set.
 5) You are a server operator with the users/auspex privilege.

Valid WHO Flags
---------------

The following flags use <pattern> to match against the specified user data:

 A     Show users who have an away message matching <pattern>.
 a     Show users who have an account name matching <pattern>.
 G     Show users who are connecting from a country code matching <pattern>.
       Requires the geoban module.
 h     Show users who have a hostname matching <pattern>. If the 'x' modifier
       is specified then this will match against the real hostname instead of
       the display hostname.
 i     Show users who have an IP address matching <pattern>.
 m     Show users who have the modes listed in <pattern>. The pattern
       should be in the same format as a mode change e.g. +ow-i (server
       operators only).
 n     Show users who have a nickname matching <pattern>.
 p     Show users who are connected to a port in the <pattern> range (server
       operators only).
 r     Show users who have a real name matching <pattern>.
 s     Show users who are on a server with a name matching <pattern>. If the 'x'
       modifier is specified then this will match against the real server name
       instead of the masked server name.
 t     Show users who have connected in the last <pattern> seconds.
 u     Show users who have a username matching <pattern>.

The following flags filter users by their status:

 f     Only show users on remote (far) servers.
 l     Only show users on the local server.
 o     Only show server operators.

The following flags modify the command output:

 x     Show sensitive data like real user hostnames and, when hideserver is
       enabled, real server hostnames.

You may combine one flag from the first group and multiple from the others in
one WHO command.

Valid WHO Fields
----------------

 a     Include the user's account name in the response.
 c     Include the first common channel name in the response.
 d     Include the user's server distance from you in the response.
 f     Include the user's away status, oper status, and highest channel prefix
       in the response.
 h     Include the user's hostname in the response. If the 'x' flag was
       specified then this is the real host rather than the display host.
 i     Include the user's IP address in the response.
 l     Include the user's idle time in the response.
 n     Include the user's nickname in the response.
 o     Include the user's channel operator rank level in the response.
 r     Include the user's real name in the response.
 s     Include the user's server name in the response. If the 'x' flag was

       name.

 u     Include the user's username in the response.

<helptopic key="extbans" title="Extended Bans" value="
Extbans are split into two types; matching extbans, which match on
users in additional ways, and acting extbans, which restrict users
in different ways to a standard ban.

To use an extban, simply set +b <ban> or +e <ban> with it as the ban,
instead of a normal nick!user@host mask, to ban or exempt matching
users. Ban exceptions on acting extbans exempt that user from matching
an extban of that type, and from any channel mode corresponding to the
restriction. Matching extbans may also be used for invite exceptions by
setting +I <extban>.

Matching extbans:

 a:<mask>      Matches user with both a matching banmask and real name,
               where <mask> is in the format nick!user@host+realname
               (requires realnameban module).
 j:<channel>   Matches anyone in the given channel. Does not support
               wildcards (requires the channelban module).
 n:<class>     Matches users in a matching connect class (requires
               the classban module).
 r:<realname>  Matches users with a matching real name (requires the
               realnameban module).
 s:<server>    Matches users on a matching server (requires the
               serverban module).
 z:<tlsfp>     Matches users having the given TLS certificate
               fingerprint (requires the sslmodes module).
 w:<gateway>   Matches users who are connecting via a WebIRC gateway that
               matches <gateway>.
 O:<opertype>  Matches server operators of a matching type, mostly
               useful as an invite exception (requires the
               operchans module).
 R:<account>   Matches users logged into a matching account (requires
               the account module).
 U:<banmask>   Matches unregistered users matching the given banmask.
               (requires the account module).

Acting extbans:

 c:<banmask>   Blocks any messages that contain formatting codes from
               matching users (requires the blockcolor module).
 m:<banmask>   Blocks messages from matching users (requires the muteban
               module). Users with +v or above are not affected.
 A:<banmask>   Blocks invites by matching users even when +A is set
               (requires the allowinvite module).
 B:<banmask>   Blocks all capital or nearly all capital messages from
               matching users (requires the blockcaps module).
 C:<banmask>   Blocks CTCPs from matching users (requires the noctcp
               module).
 N:<banmask>   Blocks nick changes from matching users (requires
               the nonicks module).
 Q:<banmask>   Blocks kicks by matching users (requires the nokicks
               module).
 S:<banmask>   Strips formatting codes from messages from matching
               users (requires the stripcolor module).
 T:<banmask>   Blocks notices from matching users (requires the
               nonotice module).

A ban given to an Acting extban may either be a nick!user@host mask
(unless stated otherwise), matched against users as for a normal ban,
or a Matching extban.

There is an additional special type of extended ban, a redirect ban:

 Redirect      n!u@h#channel will redirect the banned user to #channel
               when they try to join (requires the banredirect module).
