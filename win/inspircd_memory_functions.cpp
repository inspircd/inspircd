/** On windows, all dll files and executables have their own private heap,
 * whereas on POSIX systems, shared objects loaded into an executable share
 * the executable's heap. This means that if we pass an arbitrary pointer to
 * a windows DLL which is not allocated in that dll, without some form of
 * marshalling, we get a page fault. To fix this, these overrided operators
 * new and delete use the windows HeapAlloc and HeapFree functions to claim
 * memory from the windows global heap. This makes windows 'act like' POSIX
 * when it comes to memory usage between dlls and exes.
