Thanks for installing InspIRCd!

In order to get your server running you need to create config files. Examples
can be found at `@EXAMPLE_DIR@`.

If you need any help with this then you can visit our support channel at
irc.chatspike.net #inspircd, open a support discussion at https://git.io/JIuYv,
or refer to the the docs site:

	https://docs.inspircd.org/@VERSION_MAJOR@/configuration
	https://docs.inspircd.org/@VERSION_MAJOR@/modules

When you are done you can run the following command to start InspIRCd:

	@BINARY_DIR@/inspircd

If you have installed from an official package you may need to prefix this
command with `sudo -g @GROUP@ -u @USER@` to run as the correct group/user.

You can also use one of the helper scripts in `@SCRIPT_DIR@`.
