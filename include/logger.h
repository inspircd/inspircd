/*
 * New world logging!
 * The brief summary:
 *  Logging used to be a simple affair, a FILE * handled by a nonblocking logging class inheriting from EventHandler, that was inserted
 *  into the socket engine, and wrote lines. If nofork was on, it was printf()'d.
 *
 *  We decided to horribly overcomplicate matters, and create vastly customisable logging. LogManager and LogStream form the visible basis
 *  of the new interface. Basically, a LogStream can be inherited to do different things with logging output. We inherit from it once in core
 *  to create a FileLogStream, that writes to a file, for example. Different LogStreams can hook different types of log messages, and different
 *  levels of output too, for extreme customisation. Multiple LogStreams can hook the same message/levels of output, meaning that e.g. output
 *  can go to a channel as well as a file.
 *
 *  HOW THIS WORKS
 *   LogManager handles all instances of LogStreams, classes derived from LogStream are instantiated and passed to it.
