	 * A quick side-rant about the next group of numerics..
	 * There are clients out there that like to assume that just because they don't receive a numeric
	 * they know, that they have joined the channel.
	 *
	 * If IRC was at all properly standardised, this may even be a semi-acceptable assumption to make,
	 * but that's not the case as we all know, so IT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. Especially for Insp users, where
	 * differing modules MAY potentially choose to block joins and send NOTICEs or other text to the user
	 * instead!
	 *
	 * tl;dr version:
	 *   DON'T MAKE YOUR CLIENT ASSUME YOU JOINED UNLESS YOU RECEIVE A JOIN WITH YOUR DAMN NICK ON IT.
	 * Thanks.
