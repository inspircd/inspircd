#ifndef NUMERICS_H

/*
 * This file is aimed providing a string that is easier to use than using the numeric
 * directly.
 *
 * Module authors, please note!
 *  While you are free to use any numerics on this list, like the rest of the core, you
 *  *should not* be editing it!
 *  You should just WriteNumeric(444, .. or whatever as you would before this file, OR:
 *  #define RPL_MYNUMERIC 444 & WriteNumeric(RPL_MYNUMERIC, ...
 *
 *  If you *do* have a suggestion for a numeric you genuinely believe would be useful,
 *  please speak to us. :)
 *
 * Thanks to Darom, jackmcbarn and Brain for suggesting and discussing this.
 *
 * Please note that the list may not be exhaustive, it'll be done when I have
 * nothing better to do with my time. -- w00t (jul 13, 2008)

	 * tl;dr version:
	 *   DON'T MAKE YOUR CLIENT ASSUME YOU JOINED UNLESS YOU RECIEVE A JOIN WITH YOUR DAMN NICK ON IT.
	 * Thanks.
